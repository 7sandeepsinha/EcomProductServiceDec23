Serialisation -> process for converting an object to a json string


Controller -> Input -> DTO, Output -> DTO, Downstream(service) -> DTO
controller only deals with DTOs

Service -> Input -> DTO, Output -> DTO, DownStream(Repository) -> Entity
layer at which dto to entity, or entity to dto conversion happens
conversion can be part of business logic

Repository -> Input -> Entity, Output -> Entity, DB saves Entity

Client -> Input -> DTO, Output -> DTO, all DTO

classes


HW ->
Create 2 APIs, 1 in product controller, 1 in cart controller
make both of them return same custom exception
add 2 handler methods in each advice classes for that exception, and check
the code flow
